Basic Task-3: **Combat Online Plagiarism with AI**

**Objective of this project:**
The objective of the "Combatting Online Plagiarism with AI" project is to develop an AI-powered tool that can automatically detect instances of plagiarism in online content. The primary focus is on protecting the original work of authors and organizations by identifying similarities between text documents and flagging potential cases of plagiarism. The key goals are:

**Efficiency**: Provide a fast and automated solution for plagiarism detection to save time compared to manual methods.

**Accuracy**: Utilize advanced natural language processing and machine learning techniques to accurately identify similarities and potential instances of plagiarism.

**User Empowerment**: Empower authors, educators, news organizations, and content creators with a tool that helps them safeguard their original content.

In this we need to use text files to find and check the plagiarism after developing the comabat online plagiarism project with AI.As per the project I develop:

**Steps of Developing the Project**:

1.**Data Preparation**:
Collect a set of text documents (in this case, .txt files) that need to be checked for plagiarism. These documents represent the content available on the internet.

2.**Text Vectorization**:
Use the TF-IDF vectorization technique to convert the text documents into numerical vectors. This step is performed by the vectorize function in the code.

3.**Similarity Calculation**:
Calculate the cosine similarity between pairs of text vectors. The similarity function computes the similarity between two documents.

4.**Plagiarism Detection**:
Implement the check_plagiarism function to iterate through all combinations of text documents, calculate similarity scores, and identify potential instances of plagiarism.

5.**Result Display**:
Print the pairs of documents and their corresponding similarity scores to the console.


 **Real-Life Applications**:

1.**Academic Integrity**:
Educational institutions can use this tool to identify and address plagiarism in student assignments, maintaining academic integrity.

2.**Content Creation**:
Authors and content creators can use the tool to ensure that their work is not being copied or plagiarized by others.

3.**News Organizations**:
News outlets can utilize the tool to verify the originality of their articles and identify potential cases of content theft.

4.**Online Platforms**:
Content management systems and online platforms can integrate this tool to automatically scan user-submitted content for plagiarism before publication.

5.**Legal Support**:
The tool can aid legal professionals in assessing potential copyright infringement cases by identifying similarities between documents.
